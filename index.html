                <h1>An Open Letter to the Concerned Reynolds Family</h1>
                <p class="lead">
Tue Feb 7, 2017
</p>
<h4>
  <br>
  </br>
Dear concerned members of the Reynolds family,
</h4>
<p>
It was communicated to me earlier today that mother had been hired by the whole family as the messenger to speak with me regarding the awfully dismal situation of my life. Though I find it somewhat absurd that I should need to validate my existence by creating this website, I will attempt to address, and ease your concerns by giving an update to my progress as a functioning member of society.</p>
<h4>
  <br>
  </br>
Post Graduation
</h4>
<p>
After graduating The Iron Yard, I did not take advantage of the career opportunities that were available to me and instead chose to move to NJ with optimism of starting a multi-faceted company with a friend – a dream of mine, to create jobs for people and earn an income while not working.
</p>
<h4>
  <br>
  </br>
Newport
</h4>
<p>
Unfortunately, the above did not pan out well for personal reasons and I made the decision to leave abruptly and ask Nana if I could stay with her in Newport, as spending quality time with her was something I had been wanting to do as she is getting older and I never had that opportunity.
</p>
<p>
While there, I spent a lot of time getting to talk with Nana and met a whole lot of Reynolds I didn’t even know existed, fixed up the house some, and helped her go through and sort out her many photos to distribute – something she had been wanting to do but was having difficulty because of her poor vision and inability to lift the heavy boxes.
</p>
<p>
I worked hard at two jobs to pay off all of my credit card debt, but also had a fun time riding jet skis, sailing, waiting tables and taking trips with Thea to Boston, Providence, New Hampshire, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and New York City – all without a car.
</p>
<p>Though I interviewed and got a job at Trinity Solar selling solar panels, I decided to turn down the offer and chose instead to move back to Florida with Thea with the intention of 1) Getting a car, and 2) Driving Uber Select, until 3) I got a job in Orlando, and 4) Was able to move into an apartment with Thea.
</p>
<h4>
  <br>
  </br>
Florida
</h4>
<p>
Fast forward to now.
</P>
<p>
Mom says everyone is concerned that I am thirty (I’m 28, btw) and wasting life away, uninspired, unmotivated, and tragically lazy – a changed Michael.
</p>
<p>
There must be some misunderstanding…
</p>
<p>
I’ve been here for just over a month and in that time, I’ve: purchased a car, moved to Orlando, moved back from Orlando (sexist roommates), got Mom a new laptop, went with her up to VA to get her new dog, talked with Eastern Florida State College and found that I was ineligible for financial assistance because I already have a bachelors degree, tried to sign up at Career Source Brevard for a CNC programming state-funded course for manufacturing jobs in the area but didn’t qualify because I was not laid off from a previous employer nor am I currently receiving food stamps…
</p>
<p>
All while, yes, you guessed it - napping in my car two nights a week while driving Uber and Lyft for three days straight on the weekends in Orlando and Tampa to make the money I need to make to pay my bills until I’ve gotten a position that is more substantial and steady.
</p>
<p>
Though being a taxi driver may not be a glamorous job in everyone’s eyes and it has its inherent risks, it does provide me with the flexibility to choose my own hours, to be my own boss, to work as hard as I want rather than receiving an hourly wage, and I actually enjoy being a taxi driver – it’s fun, I like driving, and I meet all sorts of people.
</p>
<p>
I nap in my car because I don’t mind doing it for a few hours to save money on hotels and time driving back and forth, and - I’ve done it just fine for the past 3 years all over the country and for 3 months straignt while managing to graduate from the coding bootcamp in Orlando.
</p>
<p>
Mom – I’m sorry for occupying your home and being a burden to you; quite obviously, I should have 6 homes of my own by now and I should feel ashamed to be struggling at this age in my life. Thanks for your generosity in allowing Thea and I to stay until I can get back on my feet.
</p>
<p>
To everyone else, I apologize for being inadequate and not meeting your expectations, but I promise I am trying to gain my own independence as quickly as I can.
</p>
<p>I have an interview in Orlando on Thursday to be an associate food scientist at Coca-Cola. The pay is $18/h and I’ll be able to Uber after work until I can afford to rent an apartment in Orlando on my own.
</p>
<p>I also plan on staying connected with the tech community in Orlando and going to open hack nights, startup events, and UX design meet-ups in my spare time.
</p>
<p>A little support instead of constant criticism would be nice, and an understanding that I am moving as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>Sincerely,
</p>
<p>The little rascal - Michael
